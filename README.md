## Challenge submission process

![challenge flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6860637/82320094-03da2a80-99d3-11ea-913a-9c219329214c.png)

### Challenge Idea

New challenges can be proposed by any member of the community.

To propose a new **Challenge Idea** [open an issue](https://github.com/YouAreUto/YouAreUto/issues/new?assignees=&labels=challenge+proposal&template=new-challenge-idea.md&title=New+Challenge%3A+%3Ctitle%3E) describing:

1. Challenge name
2. Rules (victory condition and constraints)
3. Solution

If you want to submit a challenge idea and you don't have a GitHub account, send us an email to hello@youareuto.com

Each challenge needs to follow these guidelines:

1. Rules need to be displayed during the game
2. At least one rule needs to be changed by the player in order to win

The original author(s) of the challenge will be credited (if they so desire)
in a dedicated page of the official app (YouAreUto).

### Challenge Prospect

Challenge Ideas that are interesting and are in accordance with YouAreUtoâ€™s criteria will be labeled as `prospect` by the admins.

A **Challenge Prospect** could take inputs and ideas from any member of the
community with the aim to improve the challenge if possible.
In any case the intent should be to preserve the original idea as much as possible.

Only Prospects can eventually become Official Challenges.

Once a Prospect is defined, the original authors can start the development and
they can ask for help to the community for the design and development.

Community members cannot independently take over other membersâ€™ ideas.

### Official Challenge

When a challenge is fully developed and tested the admins make it an
Official Challenge and add it to the official app.

Each Official Challenge gets a progressive number (i.e. the first
Official Challenge after the MVP will get number 6).

### Challenge Development

To create a new challenge, follow these steps:

- Fork the repository
- Clone the project on your computer
- Open the project with [Godot 3.4.2](https://godotengine.org/download)
- Create a new **Node2D** scene in `scenes/ChallengesProspects/<Username>-<ChallengeTitle>/<ChallengeTitle>.tscn`
- The Node2D root node needs to extend the `Challenge.gd` class:
  - Add a script to your root Node2D
  - Make sure it `extends Challenge`
  - Set the `title` variable in `_init()` (eg: `title = "My Challenge"`)
- Instance `objects/UTO.tscn`
- Create your unique challenge!
- You can:
  - include generic components found in `res://objects/Components`
  - dispatch the `victory` signal
  - dispatch the `game_over` signal
- Create a Pull Request to submit your challenge ðŸŽ‰

You don't need to create the challenge title audio (eg: [C1.ogg](https://github.com/YouAreUto/YouAreUto/blob/master/assets/sounds/C1.ogg)).  
We will create it and integrate it in the game.

You can find an example in [scenes/ChallengesProspects/ExampleChallenge/](./scenes/ChallengesProspects/ExampleChallenge/)
